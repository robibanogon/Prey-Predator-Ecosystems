*A critically-acclaimed blockbuster hit, Twilight 4: Old Moon brings us back to Forks, Washington where vampires have returned to feast on innocent, naive humans.*

A simulation of a prey-predator ecosystem represented as humans (prey) and vampires (predator). Both humans and vampires have the same speed, while their movements are randomly generated. Since they lose energy as they move around their environment, they must replenish their energy by eating. Humans must consume flowers, while vampires must eat, or in this sense bite, humans, within a 10-unit radius. Flowers give humans an additional 30 units of energy when consumed, while humans give vampires 10% of their energy when they are eaten. Flowers reproduce every 5 ticks, while humans and vampires have a probability of 0.1% to reproduce every step they take.
